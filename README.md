  ## Description
  <a name= 'description'></a>
  This project runs an online shop. It will read what we have in shop. It will show you all the product you have in your system, you can add to the list, update the list and delete items off the list.

  ## Installation
  <a name= 'installation'></a>
  "npm i" will install the dependencies.

  ## Usage
  <a name= 'usage'></a>
  To use the E-Commerce, you'll first need to run npm i in the terminal. After that, open SQL and source the schema. Next, open the server file and change false to true and run "node seeds/" and npm start" (you should change the true back to false at this point.) Finally, you can run to insomnia and run your GET, POST, PUT and, DELETE requests.
